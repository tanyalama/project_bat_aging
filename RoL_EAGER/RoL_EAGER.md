We'll be working collaborative to run Hiller's TOGA annotation pipeline on Antrozous on [the TTU server](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/hpcc/userguides/general_guides/login_general.php)

To Do:
Masking genome -- repeatmasker and repeatmodeler. Nikki or Diana (wait for repeatmasker to get reinstalled)

We're going to start testing TOGA on Antrozous. Is there a "save" point for . 

n proteins annotated, visualize on browser and more completeness of exomes
